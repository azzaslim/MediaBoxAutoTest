# Introduction 
Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.

We make it possible to:

Set up tests
Write tests
Run tests
Debug Tests
Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.

This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests.

# Getting Started
For run : 
1. command in terminal : npm install
2. Choose which server to test on in config.json (server value) 
3. npx cypress open (web version) OR npx cypress run --browser chrome (terminal version)
